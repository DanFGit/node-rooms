# node-rooms

Trying out node for the first time, attempting to copy the Jackbox games method of users joining rooms - all a user needs to enter is a username and room ID. Events are emitted to the room when a user joins or leaves a room.

# Setup
`git clone` this repository and run `npm install` and hopefully everything will work when you start the server with `node server` and navigate to `localhost:3000`
